/*
 1. Given an array of words, find the index of the first word that starts with the letter "s", ignoring case.
 ["Apple", "banana", "Cherry", "strawberry", "Grape", "sandwich"]


 2. Given an array of words:
 ["tree", "queue", "sky", "cooperate", "apple"]
 Find the index of the first word that has more than 3 vowels.
 Vowels: a, e, i, o, u (ignore case)

 3. Given an array of strings: —> little complex

 ["Bob", "Alice", "john", "BOB", "ALICE", "mike"]

 Find the index of the first word that appears more than once, ignoring case.

 So "Bob" and "BOB" should count as duplicates.
 Same for "Alice" and "ALICE".
 Expected result:
 The first repeated (case-insensitive) word is "BOB", which appears at index 3.
 So the answer should be:
 Index = 3

// 1.
