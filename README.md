# Array Methods – Swift Practice

A clean, focused repository of Swift playgrounds for practicing **array methods** and common array-based interview questions. The exercises are written in Xcode Playgrounds and emphasize practical examples, explanations, and readable code.

## About

This repo contains hands-on practice focused on Swift array APIs and functional patterns (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.). It’s designed to help you:

* Understand core array operations and their trade-offs
* Build confidence solving common interview-style array problems
* Improve code readability and documentation habits

### `ArrayMethods.playground`

A guided playground with concise examples for each major array API:

* Adding & removing elements (`append`, `removeLast`, `removeAll`, ...)
* Finding & checking (`contains`, `firstIndex(of:)`, `isEmpty`)
* Sorting & reordering (`sorted`, `sort`, `reverse`, ...)
* Higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `compactMap`, `flatMap`, `forEach`)

Each example includes a short explanation and console output so you can observe behavior quickly.

### `AssignmentQstns.playground`

A collection of assignment-style problems and solutions. Intended sections:

* Basic array manipulation tasks
* Sorting problems
* Searching problems
* Functional programming exercises
* Tricky fresher-level interview questions
* Pattern-based logical problems

Placeholders are already present so you can add more problems as you practice.

---

## Usage

1. Open the `ArrayMethods.playground` in Xcode (or Xcode Playgrounds).
2. Run the playground to see inline results and print output in the console.
3. Add new examples or assignments in `AssignmentQstns.playground` as you practice.

**Tips:**

* Keep small, isolated examples for every method so behavior is easy to test.
* Add short comments explaining *why* a method is used or when it’s more appropriate than alternatives.

## Learning goals

* Strengthen Swift array skills
* Learn to choose the correct array method for a given problem
* Gain fluency with functional programming patterns in Swift
* Write clear and testable playground code

---

## Requirements

* macOS (version compatible with your Xcode)
* Xcode (supports Swift Playgrounds)
* Basic Swift knowledge
